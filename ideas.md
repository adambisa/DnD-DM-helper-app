Hi to anyone who might read this, 
This is the first in line of some of my projects. Here is a basic app usable by dungeon masters to help streamline their games.
App will have multiple features such as the ones I am already working on (see bellow), or any other I can come up with. Feel free to play around with the code.


IMPORTANT:improve visuals

COMING SOON: dice roller, initiative tracker, basic player stats, random encounter gen, npc name gen
